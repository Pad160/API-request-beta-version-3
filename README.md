# Webbpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

## Beta Version 3

The API call is now possible and the CORS error is fixed.
The output is now undifined if request to API

## Probable next steps

GET 401 (Unauthorized) - how to work with env to to show the API my key and ID

## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo down to your computer:

git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/webpack-express.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in index.js
